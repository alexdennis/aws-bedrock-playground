## AI21 (Jurassic-2 Ultra):

Violet Baudelaire is the eldest of the three Baudelaire orphans, and her siblings are Klaus Baudelaire and Sunny Baudelaire.

Violet is skilled in inventing things, and she often uses her talents to help the Baudelaires solve puzzles and problems they encounter. She invents a makeshift lockpick to escape the locked library in The Austere Academy, and constructs a grappling hook to help them reach a tower in The Vile Village.

Klaus is skilled in research, and he often uses his knowledge of the subjects he studies to help the Baudelaires solve mysteries and navigate difficult situations. He discovers the secret of the sugar bowl in The Ersatz Elevator, and decodes the message hidden in the dessert in The Hostile Hospital.

Sunny is skilled in biting things, and often uses her teeth to help the Baudelaires solve problems and defeat enemies. She bites through the ribbon that saves them from the bomb in The Slippery Slope, and bites through the lock that holds the key to their escape in The Miserable Mill.

Together, the Baudelaires use their different skills to work together and survive the dangers they encounter in the unfortunate events that befall them.
